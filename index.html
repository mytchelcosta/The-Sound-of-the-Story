                    <p>It is a sentiment echoed by legendary filmmakers like George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola: sound is half the movie. Steven Spielberg goes further, stating, "Our ears lead our eyes to where the story lives". Yet, for all its power to evoke emotion, build worlds, and drive narrative, the art of sound remains largely unseen and its language, a mystery to many outside the dub stage. This report serves as the definitive key to understanding that language. It is designed not merely as a glossary of terms, but as a comprehensive and exhaustive dictionary—a guided tour through the professional lexicon of sound design for film, television, documentaries, and other visual media.</p>
                    <p>The language of sound professionals is a unique and potent fusion of disparate disciplines. It blends the hard physics of <TermLink key='Acoustics'>acoustics</TermLink> with the subjective artistry of music, the technical precision of digital signal processing with the gritty, practical slang of the film set. To understand a conversation between seasoned professionals is to navigate concepts of <TermLink key='Psychoacoustics'>psychoacoustics</TermLink>, the intricacies of a post-production workflow, and the creative shorthand that translates a director's abstract emotional note into a concrete sonic reality.</p>

This division is not merely for organizational convenience; it is the central technical and creative principle that enables the precise control, flexibility, and artistic manipulation required to build a compelling sonic narrative.

It consists of the spoken words of the actors, and in the hierarchy of the mix, it is almost always king. This principle acknowledges the inherent privilege of the human voice in audiovisual media; our brains are hardwired to prioritize it, and thus the soundtrack is constructed to ensure its clarity and intelligibility above all else. The dialogue stem is itself a composite of several distinct types of recordings, each with its own place in the workflow.</p>

It has the power to set the atmosphere, manipulate pacing, and guide the audience's emotional response to the narrative, often on a subconscious level.

                            <p><strong><TermLink key='Score'>Score (or Underscore)</TermLink>:</strong> This is the original music composed specifically for the film. As a <TermLink key='Non-Diegetic Sound'>non-diegetic</TermLink> element—existing outside the world of the story—it comments on the action and tells the audience how to feel.</p>
                            <p><strong><TermLink key='Source Music'>Source Music</TermLink>:</strong> This is music that originates from a source within the film's world, such as a car radio, a jukebox, or a live band at a party. It is <TermLink key='Diegetic Sound'>diegetic</TermLink>, meaning the characters in the story can hear it along with the audience.</p>
                            <p><strong><TermLink key='Temp Score'>Temp Score (Temporary Music)</TermLink>:</strong> During the editing process, picture editors often use pre-existing music to establish a rhythm and emotional tone. This temporary soundtrack is known as the "temp score." While a useful guide, it can lead to a common professional challenge where the director becomes so attached to the temporary music that they have difficulty accepting the composer's original score.</p>`

                            <p><strong><TermLink key='Designed Effects'>Designed Effects</TermLink>:</strong> For elements that do not exist in the real world—such as the sound of a spaceship's engine, a magical spell, or a creature's roar—sound designers create new sounds from scratch.

                                <li><strong>Feet:</strong> The creation of footsteps, which must match the character's shoes, the surface they are walking on, and the emotion of their movement.</li>
                                <li><strong>Moves:</strong> The subtle sounds of clothing—the swish of a jacket, the rustle of a dress, the creak of a leather coat—as a character moves.</li>
                                <li><strong>Specifics (or Props):</strong> The sounds of any object a character interacts with, such as setting down a glass, handling a weapon, or turning the pages of a book.</li>

                    content: `<h2>Sound as Story</h2><p>Beyond the technical processes and workflow, sound design is fundamentally a storytelling art. Professionals in the field share a conceptual vocabulary that allows them to discuss the narrative and psychological impact of their work. This language moves beyond the "how" of creating sound to the "why"—exploring how sonic choices shape an audience's perception, guide their emotions, and construct the very reality of the film's world.</p>`,

The diegesis is the narrative world of the film—the reality in which the characters exist. All sounds are categorized based on their relationship to this world.</p>
                            <p><strong><TermLink key='Diegetic Sound'>Diegetic Sound</TermLink>:</strong> This is any sound whose source is located within the story world. This includes the dialogue spoken by characters, the sound of a car driving past on screen, or music playing from a radio in a character's room. Crucially, the characters within the film can hear these sounds.</p>
                            <p><strong><TermLink key='Non-Diegetic Sound'>Non-Diegetic Sound</TermLink>:</strong> This is any sound whose source is outside the story world. The most common examples are the musical score and a narrator's voiceover. These sounds are imposed on the scene for the benefit of the audience; the characters in the film cannot hear them.</p>
                            <p>Filmmakers often play with the boundary between these categories. A <TermLink key='Sound Bridge'>Sound Bridge</TermLink>, for example, is a technique where sound from one scene carries over into the next, or the sound of the next scene begins before the picture changes.</p>`

                            <p><strong>The Cocktail Party Effect:</strong> This principle describes the brain's remarkable ability to focus its auditory attention on a particular stimulus while filtering out a range of other stimuli.

                            <p><strong><TermLink key='Emotional Realism'>Emotional Realism</TermLink> vs. Physical Realism:</strong> A key principle is that the goal is not always to replicate reality, but to create a heightened version of it that serves the story's emotional needs. A real-life punch, for example, often sounds underwhelming. A filmic punch is a carefully constructed effect designed to convey the feeling of impact. This leads to the creation of <TermLink key='Hyper-real Sound'>Hyper-real Sound</TermLink>, which is exaggerated for dramatic effect but is accepted by the audience as emotionally true.</p>`
